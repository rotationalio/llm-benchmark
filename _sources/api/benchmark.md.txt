# Benchmark Library

The benchmark library contains the runner for executing benchmarks and the abstract base class that all benchmarks must inherit from (as well as some other helper functionality).

## Runner

```{eval-rst}
.. automodule:: construe.benchmark.runner
    :members:
    :undoc-members:
    :member-order: bysource
    :show-inheritance:
```

## Benchmark ABC

```{eval-rst}
.. automodule:: construe.benchmark.base
    :members:
    :undoc-members:
    :member-order: bysource
    :show-inheritance:
```

## Limit Utility

```{eval-rst}
.. automodule:: construe.benchmark.limit
    :members:
    :undoc-members:
    :member-order: bysource
    :show-inheritance:
```
